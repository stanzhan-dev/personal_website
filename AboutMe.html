    <h2>What I Strive For</h2>
    <p>I am a sophomore currently majoring in Computer Information Systems at Baruch College, and I am planning on minoring in Computer Science. As of today, I am learning coding languages such as Python, HTML, and CSS not only as a hobby of mine but also to prepare for my career, as I plan on learning more coding languages to add to my special skill set. Through self-learning HTML and CSS, I have created a personal website that people can use to learn more about me, my skills, and any other personal projects I have created. Throughout my education at Baruch College, even though I am a beginner, I am aware of the core cybersecurity principles, such as network security, encryption, and ethical hacking. My short-term goals are to continue my education in cybersecurity to deepen my understanding through online courses, obtaining certifications, and learning more coding languages. My long-term goals are becoming either an ethical hacker, security analyst, or software developer. What sets me apart from others is that I feel the need to constantly grow and be extremely resourceful; I am always continually learning and improving my skills in coding languages, which in turn allowed me to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, especially when I was creating my own website. I have faced several roadblocks, such as adding quality-of-life features like a navigation bar for people to easily switch between links, but I overcame this problem by using the resources available to me like Google and YouTube videos.
